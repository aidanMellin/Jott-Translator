# Jott-Translator

This is a translator project for converting an arbitrary "coding" language into various other languages. These include:
    - C
    - Java
    - Python
    - (Back to the same arbitrary language)

It incorporates a Parser and a Tokenizer along with the requisite translator. It uses a bunch of arbitrary rules to determine whether it's a alid initial Jott code.

This was a project completed by myself and friends as primarily a thought experiment, but it works rather well, if we do say so ourselves.
